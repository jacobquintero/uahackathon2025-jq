U of A Applied Math Hackathon 2025

The training data is contained in train.csv.  Testing data is contained in test.csv. 

The slides from the lecture sessions are in the powerpoint. 

The PDF contains all the relevant background and outlines the problems. 

Your mission should you choose to accept it is to apply Functional Data Analysis to assign cluster numbers to the subjects in train.csv, then train a classification method to predict cluster number from baseline covariates.  

Once you have trained the classifier, you will use it to predict cluster number for the subjects in test.csv.   I will compare your predicted cluster number to the 'true' values.

Good luck!
